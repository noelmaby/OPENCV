OpenCV Eye Tracking and Hand Gesture Recognition project

Welcome to the OpenCV Eye Tracking and Hand Gesture Recognition project! This repository hosts Python code that combines the power of OpenCV to perform real-time eye tracking and hand gesture recognition. This project is designed for various applications, including human-computer interaction, assistive technology, and gaming.

Features:

Eye Tracking: Utilizing OpenCV's computer vision capabilities, this project can accurately track the movement of a user's eyes in real-time. Eye tracking is a valuable tool for gaze analysis and controlling on-screen elements.

Hand Gesture Recognition: The system is equipped to recognize and interpret hand gestures performed in front of the camera. You can define custom gestures and associate them with specific actions, making it suitable for interactive applications.

Real-time Monitoring: The project provides real-time monitoring of the camera feed, enabling continuous eye tracking and hand gesture recognition as users interact with the system.
